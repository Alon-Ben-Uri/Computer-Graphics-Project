This is a project I made while taking the course Computer Graphics (pictures can be found in the Description.docx file). In this C++ project I programmed the following:
- A room in which to store objects.
- A tree, a crystal ball and a flashlight (the objects).
- A robot that can be moved around, as well as the robot's arm that can be rotated at the shoulder, elbow and the wrist.

The user is able to toggle between the POV of the robot and that of the world camera, so you can either look at the world from the robot's eyes,
or from the world camera (which gives the user "the bigger picture").

Both ambient and specular light can be adjusted by right clicking (which opens a menu) and selecting which light the user would like to adjust.
Right-clicking opens a menu, and one of the presented options gives the user an explanation on how to use the application.

The differnece between the robot's POV and the camera's is that the robot's head is stationary and can only be rotated around, while the camera is 
limitless in terms of movement and rotation. It can move up, down, left and right while also being able to rotate and look at all directions.
